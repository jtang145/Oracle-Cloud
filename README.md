### MySQL Demos
MySQL [Demos](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/tree/master/mysql-demos) contain OCI scripts (in folder [scripts](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/tree/master/mysql-demos/scripts), see [howto](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/blob/master/mysql-demos/scripts/howto) for more details) for creating servers on OCI and also scripts (in client [scripts](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/tree/master/mysql-demos/client-scripts)) for starting the MySQL Server. They easiest way is to create a custom image on OCI and put all client scripts on that image.

There are also some demos on how to setup and run InnoDB Cluster and InnoDB ReplicaSet on OCI in the [demos](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/tree/master/mysql-demos/demos) folder.

### Manual install of Kubernetes on OCI
In the folder "kubernetes-install" there is a text [file](https://github.com/wwwted/Oracle-Cloud/blob/master/kubernetes-install/K8s-Howto.txt) covering how to install and and setup k8s.

### Running MySQL on Kubernetes
This demo have been tested using Oracle Cloud (OCI) but there are no spcific OCI features used. Standard Kubernetes and NFS have been used in all examples so everything should work also on other cloud providers or on-prem.
